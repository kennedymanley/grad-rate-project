## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(kableExtra)                     # for printing tables
library(cowplot)                        # for side by side plots
library(lubridate)                      # for dealing with dates
library(maps)                           # for creating maps
library(tidyverse)

# read in the cleaned data
grad_train = read_csv("data/clean/grad_train.csv")

# examine counties with schools that have 100% graduation rate
top_grad_rate = grad_data %>% 
  select(county_code, county_name, grad_rate) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(desc(grad_rate)) %>%
  select(county_name, grad_rate) %>%
  head(62)

top_grad_rate %>% kable(format = "latex", row.names = NA,
                        booktabs = TRUE,
                        digits = 2,
                        col.names = c("County Name",
                                      "Graduation Rate"),
                        caption = "These are the counties that have at least one
                        subgroup at a school with a graduation rate of 100%")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
